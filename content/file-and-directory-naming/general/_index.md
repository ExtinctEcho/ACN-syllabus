## Naming files and directories

People often develop a habit of writing messy and unorganized code initially, only to attempt to improve the naming conventions after the code functions. This practice is problematic as it can introduce errors, and developers may overlook important details. It is far more advantageous to cultivate good coding habits from the outset. While it may seem slower initially, you will ultimately achieve greater efficiency once you become accustomed to it.

You can organize your files and directories in a logical and consistent manner by using naming conventions. The use of naming conventions helps to ensure the correct information can be located, identified, and retrieved from a file system quickly, as well as that it is stored in a secure location.

## What should I consider when naming files and directories

New files and directories (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence.

## Language specific naming conventions

- Python : {{< contentlink path="file-and-directory-naming/python" >}}
- JavaScript : {{< contentlink path="file-and-directory-naming/javascript" >}}
- Java : {{< contentlink path="file-and-directory-naming/java" >}}
