## How should I name my Python modules and packages?

When naming files and directories you should use small letters, and yours words should be separated by underscores.
This type of naming convention is called snake_case. As you would recall from the `clean code` content, this type of
naming convention is also used for naming python variable and function names. Read that again :).
