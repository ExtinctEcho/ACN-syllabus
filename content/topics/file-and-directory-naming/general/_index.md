## Naming modules and packages 

Files are refered to as modules and directories as folders or packages.

Naming conventions are rules which enable the titling of electronic and physical folders, documents and records in a consistent and logical way.
This ensures that the correct records can be located, identified and retrieved from a filing system in a timely fashion, and that they are stored 
in an appropriate secure location. 

## What should i consider when naming modules and packages

New modules and packages (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that 
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence.
