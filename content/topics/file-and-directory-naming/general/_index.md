## Naming files and directories

Naming conventions are rules which enable the titling of electronic and physical folders, documents and records in a consistent and logical way.
This ensures that the correct records can be located, identified and retrieved from a filing system in a timely fashion, and that they are stored 
in an appropriate secure location. 

## What should I consider when naming files and directories

New files and directories (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that 
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence.
