title: Intro to foundations course
---

Congrats! You made it into one of our technical foundations courses.

Getting through the full Umuzi program is pretty hard. We made this course so that we can make sure we can set as many people up for success as possible.

The idea behind this course is to allow you to master a few skills that were covered in the bootcamp. We also want to help you learn how to learn more effectively and add a little shine to some of your so-called "soft" skills. (Soft skills are hard you guys)

You can learn how to learn better. Being an effective learner will supercharge your whole life.

## How to be successful

The first thing to know is that you'll have a bunch of cards on your Tilde boards. You need to deal with those cards in the usual way.

Make sure you read everything properly and focus on understanding.

## FOCUS NOW

Understating is CRITICAL!!!

If you manage to get all your Tilde cards into the Complete column and one of our staff members talks to you and it turns out that you don't understand the code that you submitted then we wont be able to accept you into any of our full programs.

This is not a race, there is no prize for the person who finishes first.

If you can UNDERSTAND all the stuff covered in this course then you're golden. **Even if that means you move your cards slowly.**

Make sure you read everything properly.

If you submitted work during the bootcamp and you didn't 100% understand it, then please go back and revisit that stuff.  Re-do the tutorials and make sure you master the material. You should be able to do the projects yourself!

## It's our job to make content that helps you understand

That means that if anything is ambiguous or confusing, we need to sort things out so that it makes sense.

But there is a balance to be had. We wont be spoonfeeding anyone. We want to turn you into a professional in your chosen field. That means we want you to be in a position where you can overcome problems and seek understanding on your own steam. So if you ask a question that you should be able to figure out on your own we might tell you to take some time to think it through. Or we might answer your questions with more questions.

Seeking understanding is like gym for your brain.

## This is self paced learning

We will expect you to be consistent with the time that you are spending with us. Scheduling information will be communicated separately.

It is worth understanding that the material covered in this course is HARD. So it is highly recommended that you dedicate extra time to working through your coursework and practicing your skills. Maybe set aside an hour before your day job, or put in a day every weekend.

If you can build a sustainable habit then you're golden.

If you are moving too slowly and you are in danger of not finishing this foundational course in time then we'll let you know as soon as we can. Then you'll be able to adapt quickly.

## Your target

You have a lot of cards on your board. We need you to get the following into the "COMPLETE" column:

Everything up to and including the first three Assessment cards. When you move an assessment card into the "review" column then you're basically asking to be tested.

If you UNDERSTAND all the code you wrote and all the concepts listed in the assessment content then you'll do fine in the tests. Please make sure you read through the assessment content carefully.

## How the assessments work

Most of you were invited to take part in a technical session as a part of your bootcamp experience. These assessments will be very similar in format.

If you fail an assessment then it's ok! We'll let you try again. You will need to **wait at least a week before retrying** the assessment.

If you have an assessment scheduled and you can't attend then it is very important that you communicate about it ahead of time so that it can be rescheduled. We will count no-shows as failures. The same would be true for exams in any higher education institution.

## Danger zone

We work hard to maintain our reputation. It's important because our good reputation improves the lives of our learners. The vast majority of our learners go off to start careers in the fields that they pursue with us. That is partially because our stamp of approval means something.

One downside to the above is that we have to be very hard on anyone who cheats on our programs. We do occasionally need to expel people, but we really really don't like to do that.

### What is cheating?

Hopefully all this is obvious to you. But it's really important so please read it carefully anyway.

If you submit code that you wouldn't be able to write on your own then that would be considered cheating.

You can ask people to help you understand, but all the code you submit should be completely written and understood by you.

If we give you a test to write and the answers are copied from the Internet or you have someone else write your test for you then that's cheating.

You will only be considered to have passed the this course if you provably understand all the concepts covered. This understanding will be tested in our assessments (discussed above)

We aren't aiming to catch anyone out with trick questions or anything like that, if you did the work yourself we want to set you up for an epic career.


## How fast should I move?

If you look at your board you'll see a number of assessment cards. You have 3 assessments to get through, and 3 months to do it in. So one assessment per month.

This course is self-paced so you can go faster if you want to. In fact we think that many people will move faster. We just didn't want to disqualify anyone with aptitude but no experience.

## What happens when you're finished?

Your board will be loaded up with our main syllabus.

This isn't a race, understanding is golden! But also, the faster you obtain mastery of these concepts the sooner you can move forward to more challenging work.

## Meetings

From time to time you'll be invited to take part in live discussions. These will happen on Google Meet. Here's what you need to know:

1. You need to watch your inbox to make sure you don't miss any invitations
2. When you get an invitation you eed to respond to it. Say "yes" if you can make it, "no" if you cant. If you can't make it then let us know why so we can reschedule
3. Be on time. Set an alarm and try to be a few minutes early so that nothing goes wrong
4. Make sure you are somewhere with good internet and electricity. It's your professional responsibility to be present. For example, If you have load shedding you need to find a place where you can work from
5. You'll need a working microphone so you can take part in the discussions
6. Try to join on an actual computer if you can, there will generally be a screen share going on and you'll need to be able to read the code that is displayed

## The end

That's it! Good luck :)
