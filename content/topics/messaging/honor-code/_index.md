Integrity is important to us and our partners. And if you want to have an epic career, it should be important to you too.

What is Integrity?

> Integrity is doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking.

**Your job here** is to learn. You need to learn the technical materials and you need to learn how to behave like a professional.

Tilde and our projects, tests and other content exist to help you learn and to help us know how you are doing in your development. The point of this whole thing is _your_ growth, _your_ skills, _your_ future. The point is not to simply mark cards as complete.

## Here is what we expect

1. If we give you a test, then your answers will be your own. You will not copy people.
2. If we give you a project to do, you do it yourself. You can ask for help with understanding, but you need to do the work yourself.
3. If anyone tries to copy your work, say no. Tell them why it's a bad idea and help them understand the work if you can. 
4. If you get stuck, ask for help. If you think someone else needs help, be brave enough to ask the "stupid questions".
5. If you see someone who is engaging in dishonest activity, tell a staff member! If you are reviewing someone's work and it looks like they copied it, you can give it a RED FLAG and add a comment showing where they copied work from.
6. Be nice. Be respectful. Be helpful. If you have any meetings or workshops, be on time.
7. If you have any problems, communicate about them early. For example, if you are going to miss a deadline, let us know.
8. Always do your best. Follow instructions carefully. Always RTFQ (google it)

## Why does understanding matter?

If you graduate and get a job, you will be expected to solve new problems. You will be expected to create things that nobody has created before. There won't be anyone to copy. There won't be a way to cheat or hide from the system.

**If you want a solid career, understanding is golden.**

## Be curious

If you aren't actually interested in understanding the work then you are probably in the wrong place. Foster your curiosity and explore the material. 

If all you do is try to close cards without understanding the work then you'll be cheating yourself out of an education. That would be dumb. 


## What is plagiarism?

It's taking someone else's work, and submitting it as your own. That's the short version. If you are caught plagiarising we might not even let you into our full program. If you are caught plagiarising repeatedly we will have to kick you off the programme.

## Check your understanding!

It's important to understand everything before you move forward. Test yourself with these quiz questions:

- What is integrity according to the article? How does that apply to your education?
- What is the purpose of Tilde and its projects?
- Can you ask for help when working on a project?
- If you see someone cheating or engaging in dishonest activity, what should you do?
- Why is understanding important for a successful career?
- What is plagiarism, and what are the consequences of being caught plagiarizing?
