### What is Typescript

- [TypeScript](https://flaviocopes.com/typescript/) is an extension of JavaScript that adds types as well as other language features.
- Typescript was created to make it easier to write code that is compatible with the JavaScript language.
- As its name implies, adding types to JavaScript is the primary purpose of TypeScript, and it is the reason that people use it today.
- The [TypeScript compiler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling) “tsc” compiles TypeScript programs into JavaScript programs and in the process analyzes them and reports type errors.

As usual, the official docs say it best :)

Take note of that fact: IF you want to learn something new then the official documentation usually has the best and most up to date tutorial. This isn't always the case, but it's always a great place to look.

Start here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
Familiarise yourself with the entire handbook. Start from the top.

Since you are already a coder it should all feel very familiar.
