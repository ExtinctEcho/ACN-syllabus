Welcome to Tilde. We built it with love ❤️

If you are new to agile stuff, it's going to look a little weird. Don't worry. Before you get too deep into how we actually use this thing, it'll be good for you to know a bit about the principles and practices that inspired the design.

## How good agile teams work

The first thing to know is that working on a team is hard. And most techies and professionals work on teams. Back in the early days of software development things sucked. A lot. Software projects generally just failed; even big ones backed by people with really solid technical skills. Projects were mostly either late, broken, over-budget, or the features were just wrong. If you want success in this line of work, knowing how to use tech and any tools of your trade is just the tip of the iceberg lettuce.

So, after lots of suffering, the software industry started figuring out ways of working that are actually effective. There are loads and loads of things to be said about those methods. But the main thing to know for now is that we designed Tilde in such a way as to get you to practice those methods. The way you will be working through this course is really quite similar to how industry giants build epic software.

It is also important to note that these principles and practices have been adopted over many industries, and agile project management techniques are still being adopted and adapted for other industries.

## Kanban

Basically, Tilde is based on a thing called Kanban. Read this excellent article to understand what Kanban is all about: https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban

Ok cool! So, Tilde is basically a Kanban board. Each card you see on the board is a piece of work that you need to get done. And it is **your mission** to get all the cards from the Backlog to Complete.

## It's not just about moving cards

And of course, the whole point of this thing is to make sure you get the skills you need to launch your successful career. This is not a box-ticking exercise. In getting your cards to Complete you need to make sure you **really understand** all the concepts that the card is about. Don't race to finish, the point is not to move as quickly as possible. The point is to understand.

So please ask questions when you need to :)

And learn to ask questions well! (Yes, this is a skill you can develop)

**One major difference between a good coder and a bad coder is: Good coders UNDERSTAND the code**

**The goal of any course is to gain skills and understanding. Rushing through content will not help you in the long run. In fact, it will hinder you overall and could even damage your career. It is important to get into good habits around always optimising for understanding now.**
