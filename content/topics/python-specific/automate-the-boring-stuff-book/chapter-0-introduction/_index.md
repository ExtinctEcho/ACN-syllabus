title: 'Automate the boring stuff: Chapter 0 â€“ Introduction'
---

This is a great book. Lots of amazing coders started out with it. You don't need to read the whole thing, but it is generally very very useful.

## IMPORTANT

We follow PEP8 naming conventions. Automate the boring stuff DOES NOT. All of your projects need to follow this naming convention:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions

Also, Automate the boring stuff is focused on getting you to be productive, it is not focused on making you into a professional engineer. This book contains a lot of amazing knowledge, but it does not focus at all on best practices. Take every code example with a grain of salt. Think CRITICALLY about how you would implement the code if your job depended on it ;)
