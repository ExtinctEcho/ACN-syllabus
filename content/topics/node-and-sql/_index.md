#### In this topic, you will learn how to connect to a PostgreSQL database using node

- node-Postgres is a collection of Node.js modules used to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
- node-Postgres has many features like callbacks, connection pooling, prepared statements, async/await, and promises.
- connection pooling allows your application to reuse existing database connections by automatically saving the connection to a pool so it can be reused instead of having to create a new connection every time data is being retrieved/accessed. An example of this can be a cache component where data is frequently accessed and stored.
