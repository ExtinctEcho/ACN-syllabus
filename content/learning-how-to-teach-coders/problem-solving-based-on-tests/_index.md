title: Problem solving based on Coderbyte tests

This should happen after a test. Try to choose either:

- someone who did badly (to pick people up) OR
- a team mate who could do better (to add leverage to the team)

## To prepare

1. Make sure you can pass the test. Make sure you can solve the problems yourself. While solving the problems pay attention to what problem solving techniques you used
2. Look at the test report videos to get an idea of the learner's thinking
3. Think about the problem solving techniques you used and where the learner fell short

## Focus

The focus of these events is problem solving. The focus is not getting the answers to the test, the follower needs to know HOW to derive to the answer to similar and harder questions. So it's about problem solving technique.

This should help: {{% contentlink path="language-agnostic/problem-solving-technique" %}}

If it becomes clear that the follower is missing foundational skills then fall back to the deep practice technique. Zoom in on the specific skill they are missing.

## Procedure

Ask the follower if they have done any work on their own to do with overcoming their problems from the test. Ask them what question they would like to focus on unless you have a strong opinion on how to best spend time.

Share your screen, this helps with demonstrating concepts and is useful if you need to drop back into deep practice mode.

Get the learner to break down the problem in pseudocode. Ask them to tell you what to type in and write it as comments. Don't let them write useless comments that are better written as code. Comments should say what they are trying to achieve at each point in the program, the comments should not be the code written out in English sentences.

Work towards the solution together.

## Alternatively

You could also get a problem from Hackerrank or similar and apply the same general procedure.
