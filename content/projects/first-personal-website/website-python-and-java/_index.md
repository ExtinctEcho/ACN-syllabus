title: Python and Java - Build your first personal website
---

### Requirements:

- Website can be a single page or have multiple pages (the structure is up to you), but it must contain the following information:
  - About me
  - Skills (Your tech stack: the languages and tools you use)
  - Projects/Portfolio (for now this might be a bit empty, but if you've worked on anything cool then tell us about it)
  - Contact (social media, email, phone, etc)
- Host your site as a Github Page. In your README file include a link to your github page for easy navigation

## Some advice

- Your portfolio can be a simple single page portfolio that contains the above mentioned requirements.
- Make sure that only the necessary information is presented.
- Make sure your stuff is tidy. Use whitespace as needed. Make sure your pictures are not squashed or stretched.
- Website must be responsive to different screen sizes - use a mobile-first approach!
