title: Build your first personal website
---

For the learnership you will create a website with your CV and a portfolio of your work. Create the website and host it on Github. You will be expected to keep your portfolio up to date throughout the learnership.

## Instructions

Create a personal website to showcase your talents and ambitions.

The content and information you choose to display is up to you. There should be some information about your skills, interests, and previous experience, as well as information on how to get in touch with you. Think about the user experience when designing your layout and navigation.

The HTML and CSS should be developed in a logical way with good naming conventions that would allow another developer to easily understand and build upon your code. There is something called "Semantic Markup" - read all about it [here](https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/).

You can also make use of this cool [markup validation tool](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML code used in your website.

Your web page files and folders should be organized and named in a logical manner.

Once you have finished your design and are satisfied with the style and content, upload the website to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Please submit a link to your website. DO NOT submit a link to your github repo. We dont want to clone your website, we want to look at what you built.
