title: Java Streams
---

Remember your semitone challenge project? well, for this project we are about to make the semitone project a bit cooler by using other functions to process the very same data structures.

## Instructions

Update your semitone project implementation so that it makes use of at least three stream operators. As always, make sure you test your code thoroughly.

### Instructions for the reviewer

- Ensure that 3 or more stream functions are used.
- Ensure that tests exist, they should test the logic where streams are used.
