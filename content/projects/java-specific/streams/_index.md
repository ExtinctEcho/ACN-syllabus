title: Java streams
---

Remember your semitone challenge project ***(see prerequisites above)*** well for this project we are about to make that project more cooller.

The requirements here is that you should have already submitted your semitone project with basic algorith and now we are going to use other functions to process those data structures.

#### Instructions:

Pretty simple just use atleast three operators of streams to refactor your implementation of the semitone challenge, make sure you test your logic aspecially the paths that use streams.


#### Instructions to the review
- Ensure they used three or more stream function

- Ensure they have tests that cover logic where streams are used
