We are going to work on Spring boot **Caching** and **Security** for the project we created in part1 and part2

## Caching

Continuing with {{% contentlink path="projects/java-specific/introduction-to-spring-boot/part2" %}} for the **User** we are going to add **security** and **caching** on the application and we will use test and browser to see if the application does what we expect.

**Step 1**

Import the following dependency

```
dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-cache'
}
```

**Step 2**

Implement caching for the 'name' in the "getUser" method, use the right annotation to invoke this ðŸ˜‰, in order to see if something is being served from cache or not we are going to simulate our own delay.

Add this code on your getUser method just before the return statement

```
try
{
    System.out.println("Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.");
    Thread.sleep(1000*5);
}
catch (InterruptedException e)
{
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Use the rest API you created in Part 2 to test your cache

Write an integration test (Testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group) that will call the endpoint which invokes the `getUser` function four times

Expect output

**Without Cache:**

```
Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.
Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.
Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.
Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.

```

**With Cache:**

```
Going to sleep for 5 Secs.. to simulate backend call.
...
...
...

```

## Security

Import the following dependency

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
}
```

**Step 1**

Override the neccessary functions in the WebSecurityConfigurer class to configure your own username and password

**Step 2**

Add a test to show that your username and password actually work to override the default one
