For this assessment you need to choose between two options depending on the solution you would like to test (only pick one template that best suit your project)
1. If your solution is a digital solution like a mobile app use [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1InG8AsgvVAjGxE8iXcPEs2YoXH3h9QIv2RGSDjSPboQ/edit#slide=id.g1dfb42b39be_0_0) and download the assessment template.
2. If your solution is not digital use [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOuWWCImSgH3XMjGDGzMNFEnFd1qYIotoDYpHRP6EJo/edit#) and download the assessment template.

Remember to only pick one template to use for this project.

Rename the document to include your name.

Do the assessment and follow all instructions. The instructions are in the document.

Upload the document to google drive and submit a link. 
- Ensure that the submission has the docx file extension. 
- Make sure that the link works. 
- If your work is private then we won’t be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser. Set Share to ‘Anyone with the link can view’

Your link should look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YtW4iBMCZuBYxUf1YCZGsDRFminxXKk9/view?usp=sharing or https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YtW4iBMCZuBYxUf1YCZGsDRFminxXKk9/edit
