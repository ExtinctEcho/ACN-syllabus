## Defining the Problem

Albert Einstein famously said, *"If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.”*

Now that you’ve spent time understanding your user through conducting research and building personas, the next step is to define a specific finding/problem that you will try to solve for. 

This is important as you will come away from empathising with many insights and possible directions, and this step allows you to refine your sprint to make sure you don’t fall short trying to solve for too much, and have clear direction when moving into the next steps of the process.

In Design Thinking, Defining helps in ensuring we’re solving the most important challenge our user faces. Empathise and Define are part of the problem finding. 

The Define phase allows you the chance to interpret, understand, synthesise and analyse the data into actionable information that represents the problems our users / clients face.

In the Define phase of Design Thinking you will have two tasks: building your **problem statement,** and then you will translate the problem statement into **a question.** (The question will catapult you into ideation and brainstorming solutions, but remember for now we are still framing our problem in Empathise & Define).
