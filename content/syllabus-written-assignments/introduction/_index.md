## Intro

We are adding written assignments as an important part of your learning experience. These assignments are designed to help you learn better and overcome common challenges.

## Why

Sometimes, just reading content might not be enough to fully understand certain topics. So, we want to make sure you can apply what you've learned and express your understanding clearly.

## Outcomes

By completing these written assignments, you'll be more engaged with the course material, and it will be easier for you to remember what you've learned.

Our goal is to create a supportive learning environment where you feel confident and successful. These written assignments will help you develop important skills that you can use in your studies and future career.
