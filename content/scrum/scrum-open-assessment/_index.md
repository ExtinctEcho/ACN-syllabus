title: Scrum Open Assessment
---

The scrum assessments are time based and need quick thinking and recall of scrum theory, in this open assessment we will be practicing both.

Any time you get an answer incorrect ensure that you revise the section and understand why your answer was incorrect and the reasoning behind the correct answer.

Complete the [Scrum open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open), aim to get 100% within 5 minutes, once you have completed it upload a screenshot showing that it is complete to your Google Drive and submit.

Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser.
