## Final preparation and some tips.

Well done on getting through all that content and the practice assessments. You should now be ready to pass your PSM 1 assessment.
### Before the exam

 - Ensure that you get enough sleep the night before you are writing.
 - Read through [The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) and your notes one last time.

### Writing the exam

 - Have a pen and paper read in case you need it.
 - This is an open book exam, however, you will not have time to look up every answer. If you need to research an answer note the question number and come back to it later.
 - Ensure you have both back-up power and internet available.
 - Ensure you are in a quiet place and will not be disturber for the entire 60 minutes.
 - The exam is multiple choice so use the process of elimination.
 - Pay special attention to the language used in the questions and answers. Words like "must", "never" "can", "may" can change the intent of the sentence.

## Go ace the exam!
