This is the final practice test before you write your exam.

Once again you will be rewriting this test until you can get 90% or above. Ensure that you are understanding the answers and the reasoning behind them not just memorizing the questions and answers.

Take a screenshot of your successful test, upload it to your Google Drive and submit.

Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser.
