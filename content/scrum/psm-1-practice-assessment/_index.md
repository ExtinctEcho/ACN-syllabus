[The Free Scrum Master I (PSM I) Practice Assessment](https://www.thescrummaster.co.uk/quizzes/professional-scrum-master-i-psm-i-practice-assessment/) is the final practice test before you write your exam.

Once again you will be rewriting this test until you can get 90% or above. Ensure that you are understanding the answers and the reasoning behind them not just memorizing the questions and answers.

Take a screenshot of your successful test, upload it to your Google Drive and submit.
