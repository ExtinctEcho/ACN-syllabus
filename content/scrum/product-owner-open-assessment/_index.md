The scrum assessments are time based and need quick thinking and recall of scrum theory, in this open assessment we will be practicing both.

Complete the [Product Owner open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open), aim to get 100% within 5 minutes, once you have completed it upload a screenshot showing that it is complete to your Google Drive and submit.
