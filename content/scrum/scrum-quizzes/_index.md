title: Scrum and Product Owner practice quizzes
---

Well done on your progress so far. There has been a lot covered but also a lot of revision.

Before you are ready to write the actual exam you will be doing a number of practice tests.

Write both the Product Owner and the Scrum Master Practice Tests from [ScrumQuiz.org](http://scrumquiz.org/#/) keep rewriting until you can consistently get over 90%. Ensure that you are understanding the answers and the reasoning behind them not just memorizing the questions and answers.

Take a screenshot of your successful test, put both the successful tests on one doc, upload it to your Google Drive and submit.

Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser.
