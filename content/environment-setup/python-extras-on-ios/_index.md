You can use Koder as your editor to write python code. Just be sure to save your files with the `.py` extension.

To run your python files, you need to use iSH. You can find instructions on how to install iSH [here](https://ish.app/)
Once you have iSH installed, you can install Python.

First install python like so:

```bash
apk add python3
```

To check what version o python is installed you can use the command:

```bash
python3 --version
```

The version number should be >= 3.9

Then you can open a python interpreter at any point with the command `python3`.

You can also run your python scripts like so:

```bash
cd /path/to/wherever/you/stored/your/goodies
python3 my_script.py
```

Try it out and remember to ask for help if you get stuck.
