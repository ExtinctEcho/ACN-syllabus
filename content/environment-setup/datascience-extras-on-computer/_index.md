**Please note:** If you are doing Data Engineering then this is not for you. This is only for our data scientists!

**Before you begin** Please make sure you have followed and understood everything from the following guide: {{< contentlink path="environment-setup/python-on-computer" >}}

The next thing you need are some data science specific tooling. Here are some installation instructions: [Conda installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). 

When you install Conda you basically have 2 choices. You can install Anaconda or Miniconda. Miniconda is probably the better choice. This excellent Stackoverflow post explains the difference between the two if you are interested: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45421163/anaconda-vs-miniconda#:~:text=Anaconda%20is%20a%20full%20distribution,%2C%20its%20dependencies%2C%20and%20Python.
