## Questions

1. Consider the stages of the Data Science Method. How can a strong statistics skills be helpful in the different stages? Are statistics always useful? Or only some of the time? 

2. Which measure of central tendency can be used for categorical data? Why?

3. When might the mean provide a misleading representation of a dataset? Provide an example where the median might be a more appropriate measure of central tendency.

4. How do outliers affect the mean and median differently? Illustrate with a dataset where adding an outlier significantly changes the mean but not the median.

5. In what types of data is the mode more informative than the mean and median? Give an example of a dataset where the mode provides the most valuable insight.

6. Consider a set of salaries within a company. If the CEO's salary is included in the dataset, how would this affect the mean salary compared to the median salary? What does this tell you about the distribution of salaries in the company?

7. How can the relationship between the mean, median, and mode help you understand the shape of a dataset's distribution? Describe what the relationship might look like in a positively skewed distribution versus a negatively skewed distribution.

8. Imagine you are analyzing customer review ratings for two products. Product A has ratings that are mostly 4s and 5s, with a few 1s. Product B has ratings evenly distributed from 1 to 5. How might the mean, median, and mode differ in their representation of customer satisfaction for each product?

9. Can a dataset have more than one mode? Provide an example of a multimodal dataset and discuss how multiple modes can influence the interpretation of data.

10. How does the size of a dataset impact the reliability of the mean, median, and mode? Discuss scenarios where increasing the size of the dataset could significantly change one of these measures.
