Statistics is the backbone of data science. Here are several ways in which applied statistics is fundamental to the field:

Descriptive Statistics provides tools for summarizing and understanding the basic features of data, offering a way to present large amounts of data in a simplified form.

Inferential Statistics allows data scientists to make predictions or inferences about a population from a sample of data, understanding relationships, testing hypotheses, and estimating probabilities.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a concept rooted in statistics, is a critical early step in the data science process. It involves visually and quantitatively exploring data sets to understand their underlying structures, detect anomalies, and identify patterns or relationships.

Statistical Models and Machine Learning: At their core, many machine learning algorithms are an extension of traditional statistical models, designed to predict outcomes and uncover relationships within large data sets. These models include linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, among others.
