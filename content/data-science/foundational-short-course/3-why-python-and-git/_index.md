Data science is about statistics, insights, knowledge. Data science is made possible by a set of tools.

Python and Git are 2 such tools.

You'll start learning about them shortly, but before you do, it would be useful for you to know a bit about why these tools matter. 

## Why Python

Python is a programming language. It's simply a mechanism we use to tell computers what to do. It's very powerful.

Python has become the standard language of data-science because it unlocks the use of many tools that are fantastic for wrangling, displaying and modelling data.

And, as programming languages go, it's one of the nicest ones to learn.

## What else can Python do?

If you learn Python programming then you are not limited to only doing data-science. Python is a versatile language with applications in web development, automation, business tool development and space travel (for real, google it).

## Why Git 

Programming has been around for a while. Programming has been a thing for longer than data-science has been a thing. There are certain best practices and conventions that have sprung up in the software development space that are also very relevant to data-scientists.

One such best practice is the use of Git. 

Git is an essential tool when it comes to version control and collaboration. 

Git allows individuals and teams to track changes in their code, revert to previous versions when necessary, and manage different development branches concurrently. This is crucial in a field like data science, where experiments and analyses must be reproducible and where projects often evolve over time. 

Git also facilitates collaboration among data scientists and other stakeholders by enabling a shared history and easy integration of changes in a project. By mastering Git, a data scientist can enhance project organization, streamline collaboration, and ensure the integrity and continuity of their work, making it an indispensable skill in the modern data science toolkit.

## Programmers are weird!

Git and Python are going to feel a little strange at first. Maybe a lot strange. And that's ok.

We teach these tools in this course because they are critical to the success of a professional data-scientist. And we are about building professional skills.
