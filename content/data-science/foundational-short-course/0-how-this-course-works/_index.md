title: How this course works
---

This course has a number of components. Many things are optional, and some are required.

If you only do what is required you will pass the course, but if you push yourself further by taking on the optional projects you will leave here with a higher level of skill, and you will be able to make more use of our education staff and support.

## Keeping pace 

There will be deadlines in this course. It's important that you meet them.

If you are ahead of schedule we wont hold you back. You don't need permission to read ahead or take on more advanced, optional projects.

## Skill levels 

Different people are here for different things and so our course content caters for the different strokes of the different folks.

Some people want to get a good idea of what data-science is all about and would just like to dip their toe in the water. That's ok! If this is you then please just keep up with the deadlines. We wont have any hard feelings if you don't want to dive into the most challenging work.

Other people might want to push themselves. We have included a bunch of harder projects for these people.
