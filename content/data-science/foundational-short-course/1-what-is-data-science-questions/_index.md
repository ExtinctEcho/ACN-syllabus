title: "Conceptual knowledge check: What is data science?"
---

1. Consider the steps in the DSM. Should the steps always happen in the same order? Why? Or Why not?

2. How do computational advances specifically contribute to the field of data science beyond traditional statistical analysis?

3. In what ways does the interdisciplinary nature of data science enhance its problem-solving capabilities?

4. Why is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) critical before proceeding to the modeling phase in data science projects?

5. What ethical considerations should be taken into account during the data collection and preparation phase of a data science project?

6. How does effective communication of results contribute to the success of a data science project?
