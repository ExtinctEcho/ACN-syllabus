The word "data type" can be misleading in data-science because we make use of different data-types while writing code.

This content refers to a different type of data type. 

Data is broadly categorized into four major types:

1. Categorical / Qualitative Data

    1.1. Nominal data

    1.2. Ordinal data

2. Numerical / Quantitative Data    

    2.1. Discrete data

    2.2. Continuous data

We will discuss each type in turn.

## 1 Categorical / Qualitative Data 

Qualitative data, alternatively referred to as categorical data, characterizes information that falls into distinct categories. Unlike numerical data, qualitative data is non-numeric and pertains to categorical variables describing features such as an individual's gender or hometown. Categorical measures are articulated through natural language descriptions rather than numerical values. Categorical data is further divided into two types. Nominmal and Ordinal data.

### 1.1 Nominal data

Nominal data, a form of qualitative information, involves labeling variables without assigning numerical values. Also referred to as the nominal scale, this type of data lacks order and measurement. However, in certain cases, it may exhibit both qualitative and quantitative characteristics. For Example: Nominal data include type, degree and gender.


| Nominal Variable Name | Category Name |
| --- | --- |
| Gender | Male, Female |
| Degree | Master, Bachelor |
| Blood Type | A, B, AB |

### 1.2 Ordinal data

Ordinal data or variables are characterized by a natural order among their values. Unlike nominal data, the crucial aspect of ordinal data is that the specific differences between data values are not defined. This type of variable is frequently encountered in surveys, finance, economics, questionnaires, and similar contexts.


| Ordinal Data | Types |
| --- | --- |
| Finance | Low, Medium, High |
| Education Level | Primary,Secondary, Post Secondary |
| Reviews | 1 star, 2 star, 3 star and so on |

## 2. Numerical / Quantitative Data

Quantitative data, synonymous with numerical data, denotes values expressed in numerical terms, providing information about quantityâ€”answering questions like "how much," "how often," or "how many." Numerical data pertains to the measurement of specific quantities, including examples such as height, length, size, weight, and more. 

Quantitative data can be categorized into two types based on data sets: Discrete Data and Continuous data.

### 2.1 Discrete data 

Discrete data is restricted to specific, distinct values and encompasses only a finite number of possibilities. These values cannot be further subdivided meaningfully and are typically counted in whole numbers. For example : Number of students in the class, dice result.

### 2.2 Continuous data

Continuous data is measurable and can be expressed as a range with an infinite number of potential values within a specified interval. For example : Height of the student, Weather reports.

## Check your own understanding 

For each of the examples below, is the data nominal, ordinal, discrete or continuous:

- the number of emails received on a day
- the speed at which you are running
- the different types of turtles found on the beach
- the difficulty of a problem (easy, medium, hard)

Can you think of any more examples in your own life?
