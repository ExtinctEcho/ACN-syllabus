Write a function that simply prints the string "Hello World!".

## Javascript

If you have been asked to do these tasks in JavaScript then you must use the `console.log` function to print the string.

For example:

```
console.log("something")
```

## Python

If you are using Python then you should be using print to print the string.

```
print("something")   # so this kind of thing

print "dont do this"  # if you are writing print statements like this
                      # then you are using the wrong version of Python. Please
                      # make sure you have Python 3 installed.
```
