Write a function that takes in a string and then **returns** all the vowels in the string.

The returned vowels should be:

- lowercase
- in alphabetical order

If a vowel appears twice in the input string then it should appear twice in the output.

## Language-specific instructions

- if you are using Python then your function should return a List 
- if you are writing Javascript then your function should return an Array
- if you are writing Java then your function should return an Array of Chars

## Example usage

- `task9("Hello there Andy")` should return `[a, e, e, e, o]`
- `task9("xyz")` should return `[]`

## Check your understanding

- How would you change your code if you wanted to handle multiple strings?
- How would you change your code if you wanted to look for numbers or special characters?
- If you used a loop then what kind of loop did you use and why?
- How would you change your code if you wanted to return 2 lists/arrays: one with all the vowels and one with all the consonants
- How would you change your code if we just wanted to count how many vowels were in the string?
- Play with these ideas, challenge yourself and grow :)
