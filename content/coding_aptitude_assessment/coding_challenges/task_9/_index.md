title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 9'
---

Write a function that takes in a string and then returns all the vowels in the string as a list or array.

The returned vowels should be:
- lowercase
- in alphabetical order

If a vowel appears twice in the input string then it should appear twice in the output.

Example usage:

`task9("Hello there Andy")` should return `["a","e","e","e","o"]`

## Check your understanding 

- how would you change your code if you wanted to handle multiple strings?
- how would you change your code if you wanted to look for numbers or special characters?
- if you used a loop then what kind of loop did you use and why? 
- how would you change your code if you wanted to return 2 lists/arrays: one with all the vowels and one with all the consonants 
- how would you change your code if we just wanted to count how many vowels were in the string?
- play with these ideas, challenge yourself and grow :)
