Write a function that takes in a number representing the temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Example usage:

- `task7(60)` should return `140`
- `task7(0)` should return `32`
- `task7(-10)` should return `14`

## Check your understanding

Will the following calculations give different results? Try to predict the answer before opening up a terminal and checking for yourself.

```
1 + 2 / 3 * 4
(1 + 2) / 3 * 4
4 * 1 + (2 / 3)
```

Try a few things out and make sure you understand the order of operations
