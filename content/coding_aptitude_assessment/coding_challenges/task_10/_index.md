Make a function that takes two strings as input, and print the common characters/letters that they share.

The printed letters should:
- be lowercase
- be in alphabetical order
- appear as a single string. Please see the example to see the format of the string

Example usage:

`task10("House","computers")` should print `e, o, u and s`
`task10("Hi","there")` should print `h`
`task_10("Foo","bar")` should print `no common characters`

There should only be one call to `print` or `console.log` in your whole function.
