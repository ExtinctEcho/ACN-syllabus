title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 2'
---

This task is very similar to task 1.

Write a function that takes in a single optional parameter. It should work like this:

`task2("Sally")` should print `Hello Sally!`
`task2("Tshepo")` should print `Hello Tshepo!`
`task2()` should print `Hello Friend!`

## Check your understanding! 

- How do function arguments/parameters work? 
- What happens if you pass in too many arguments? 
- How do you make an argument optional?
- How do you join multiple strings together?
- Did you use an if statement here? How was it used? 
- If you used an if statement, what happens if you don't fill in the `else` part? 
- when are multiple strings considered equal? Would this be true or false: `"Hello Sally" == "Hello, Sally"` (try it yourself to see)
