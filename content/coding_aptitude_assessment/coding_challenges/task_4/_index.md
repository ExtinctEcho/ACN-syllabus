Write a function that takes in three integer numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should calculate the area of a triangle, and then round the area down to the nearest integer value. The final answer should be **returned**. 

If the answer is a floating point number then round down. For example if the area if 6.99999 then you should return 6. 

This article will explain how to [calculate the area of a triangle](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Area-of-a-Triangle)

Example usage:

- `task4(3, 4, 5)` should return `6`
- `task4(7, 8, 10)` should return `27`
