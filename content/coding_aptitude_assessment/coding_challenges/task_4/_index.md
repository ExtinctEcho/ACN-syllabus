Write a function that takes in three numbers(integers). These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should **return** the area of a triangle as a whole number.

This article will explain how to [calculate the area of a triangle](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Area-of-a-Triangle)

Example usage:

- `task4(3, 4, 5)` should return `6`
- `task4(7, 8, 10)` should return `27`

## Check your understanding!

- how would you write a function that calculates the area of a square?
- how would you write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle?
