title: Datascience short course 1
---

This course is to be completed in 8 weeks at maximum 10 hours per week. 

Learners doing this course should first do the "Intro to Tilde for tech bootcamps" course.


## Week 1: 

Introduction to Umuzi mechanisms
Introduction to DataScience. Big picture

Workshop 1: 
- Icebreaker
- Learners are invited to ask questions about content and processes
- LX staff presence required 

Workshop 2:
- conceptual session based on DS intro 


## Week 2: Intro to Python


Sololearn and basic katas compulsory 
advanced katas and sololearn available 

## Week 3: Intro to statistics 


DS is applied statistics. But stats is big. Ref:  https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+stats+should+a+datascientist+know&oq=how+much+stats+should+a+datascientist+know&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigAdIBCDg5OTJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

Make use of Khan academy or similar. Set a cap on what is expected of learners 

Projects:
- implement statistical functions in Python from scratch. Eg calculate the mean etc 

Intro to Pandas
- calculate statistical things using dataframes

## Week 4: Breather 

People will still be working on their previous projects. Give people a chance to catch up. Faster learners can move ahead with enrichment content 

If learners are keeping up, move forward

## Week 5: EDA 1 

- Load and display data in different ways
- no real wrangling required at this point, focus on drawing stuff and knowing what graphs are useful

- simple graph projects. Maybe a datacamp thing

## Week 6: Data Wrangling 1

Something that uses data wrangling and visuals. Do we have such a thing?
