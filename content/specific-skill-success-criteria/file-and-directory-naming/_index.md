title: Naming modules and packages

# Naming modules and packages 

Files are refered to as modules and directories as folders or packages.

Naming conventions are rules which enable the titling of electronic and physical folders, documents and records in a consistent and logical way.
This ensures that the correct records can be located, identified and retrieved from a filing system in a timely fashion, and that they are stored 
in an appropriate secure location. 


# Benefits of naming conventions

Naming records consistently, logically and in a predictable way will distinguish similar records from one another at a glance, and by doing so will 
facilitate the storage and retrieval of data. Through consistency and the application of logical standards, we benefit from secure storage, and the 
ability to locate and access information.

Ideally,the best time to think about how to name and structure the documents and directories you create is at the start of a project. 


# Note to all programmers

New modules and packages (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that 
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence. 


# How should I name my PYTHON modules and packages?


Modules should have short, all-lowercase names and underscores can be used to improves readability. 


Packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
