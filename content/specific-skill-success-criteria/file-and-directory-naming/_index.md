# Naming files and folders 

It can be helpful to know what naming style is being used, independent of what it is being used for. Naming conventions are rules which enable 
the titling of electronic and physical folders, documents and records in a consistent and logical way. This ensures that the correct records can 
be located, identified and retrieved from a filing system in a timely fashion, and that they are stored in an appropriate secure location. Ideally,
the best time to think about how to name and structure the documents and directories you create is at the start of a project. 


# Benefits of naming conventions

Naming records consistently, logically and in a predictable way will distinguish similar records from one another at a glance, and by doing so will 
facilitate the storage and retrieval of data. Through consistency and the application of logical standards, we benefit from secure storage, and the 
ability to locate and access information.


## Python

New modules and packages (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that 
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence. 

### How should I name my file in Python modules and packages?

Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, 
all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.Make directories (packages) and files (modules) snake_cased. KEEP IT SHORT AND MEANINGFUL.
