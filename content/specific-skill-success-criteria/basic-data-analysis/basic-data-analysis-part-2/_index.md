## Note about submission format

On Tilde you'll notice that this card is asking for a link submission. **Please don't worry about submitting a link**. You will be assessed according to {{% contentlink path="specific-skill-success-criteria/introduction-to-assessments" %}}.

## All concepts

For each of the concepts covered below, the learner should know how to do the calculations by hand. If the learner only knows how to do this work using data science tooling (e.g. pandas) then they won't be in a good position to apply the tools correctly or reason about their output.

## Probability

The learner should be able to do simple calculations of probabilities. They should know when probabilities should be multiplied and when they should be added.

Here are a few sample questions: what is the probability of...
- throwing a 2 on a six-sided die?
- throwing an even number on a six-sided die?
- rolling 2 six-sided dice and getting a total value of 5? (e.g. one die lands on a 2 and the other on a 3)
- rolling 3 sixes in a row if you roll a six-sided die 3 times.
- rolling 3 sixes in a row if you roll a six-sided die 5 times.

## P-value

The learner should know:
- What is the minimum number that the p-value can have? What does this imply?
- What is the maximum number that the p-value can have? What does this imply?

The learner should be able to do calculations about p values based on known probabilities.

For example, if you roll a six-sided die 5 times and get 3 sixes in a row then is the die likely to be fair?
