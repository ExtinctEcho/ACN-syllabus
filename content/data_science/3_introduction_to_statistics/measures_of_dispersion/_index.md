# Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. For example : If the scores on a test range from `70 to 100`, the range is `100 - 70 = 30`.

- **Variance**: A measure of the spread of values around the mean, calculated by averaging the squared differences from the mean. For example: If you have a set of daily temperatures for a week (e.g., 72, 74, 76, 70, 73, 75, 78), you can calculate the variance to quantify how much each temperature deviates from the mean.

- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, providing a more interpretable measure of dispersion. For Example: Using the same set of daily temperatures, the standard deviation provides a measure of the average deviation of each temperature from the mean.
