## Course Overview

Welcome to the Foundational Data Science Course!
Data science, at the forefront of innovation, amalgamates programming, mathematics, and technology to scrutinize data and unearth valuable insights. The impact of data spans across all industries, and possessing the ability to discern trends and insights is a sought-after skill. Upon completing this Course, you will acquire the proficiency and tools to utilize statistics and programming for predicting outcomes, optimizing results, and providing informed guidance for business decisions.

This course is designed to ready you for your inaugural role as a data scientist by immersing you in hands-on projects mirroring the real-world tasks undertaken by data scientists globally. These projects, serving as invaluable additions to your portfolio, enable you to showcase your skills effectively to potential employers. Within this course, you will encounter articles, and interactive exercises, referring videos, delivering a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of data science. You'll have the opportunity to practice these fundamentals through practice assignments and projects.

The core focus of this course revolves around the Data Science Method (DSM), a systematic series of steps that data scientists adhere to in order to successfully execute projects. You will delve into the intricacies of each of these steps and put your understanding into practice through case studies and upcoming projects. The six essential steps include:

- Identifying the problem
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis
- Pre-processing and preparing training data
- Prepare the Model
- Interpreting data (Documentation)

Python, Statistics and Data Science are like a dynamic duo, working hand in hand like a well-coordinated dance. Python's versatility and data science's analytical prowess seamlessly blend together, much like a symphony of complementary notes in music. It's a partnership as integral as salt and pepper in cooking, where Python is the essential ingredient enhancing the flavor of data science tasks. Picture Python as the canvas and data science as the vibrant palette, creating a masterpiece together. Just as a key unlocks a door, Python unlocks the potential of data science, making them an inseparable pair.
