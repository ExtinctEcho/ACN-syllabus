title: How to submit your teach like a champion files
---

You will be making use of a Google doc to answer your questions. You will need to include the question and then provide the answer.

The file names should follow this convention:

```
quick familarity - part [number]
```

Here is an example of how we expect your work to look:

![quick familarity](quick-familarity.png)

Make sure that the sharing permisions allow anyone on the internet to view the file.

## IMPORTANT

It is critical that you use your own words when answering written assignments. If you copy-paste from the Internet or your peers then that means:

- you will not absorb the lessons you ned to absorb
- we will consider you unprofessional and that means your options will be limited and you will get less support
