Have we mentioned that writing software is hard? An unfortunate thing is that bit software projects fail all the time. There are lots of reasons for this.

Here are some good articles on the topic. This is just a starting point though.

## Instructions 

Do a bit of research and answer the following questions:

1. Why do you think Waterfall style project management seems so appealing to so many businesses? 
2. How can Waterfall style project management lead to failed software projects?
3. What is Wagile? How can it go wrong?

Each question should be answered in 300 - 500 words. 

## Submission instructions 

Create 3 markdown files. They should be named as follows:

```
question_1.md
question_2.md
question_3.md
```

You can just upload these files into the main branch of your repo. There is no need to make pull requests or anything fancy like that.

## If you are new to Github and need some help submitting your work

Follow [this  guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) to upload your files to your repo.

The guide might have a few confusing words. I'll define them briefly here:

- commit: Every time you make a change to your code on Github, then Github will keep track of what changed. You'll forever have access to every version of your code. Commit is just a special word for version. 
- commit message: Every time you make a new version of your code you're making a commit. Every commit can have a message. That way when you look over your version history you can see what you did when. This gets useful on big projects or when you are working on a team because you will be able to see the whole history of the project.

You'll be asked if you want to add your code to the main branch or if you want to create a new branch. Branches are cool, trust me, but we aren't going to get into them right now.  Just choose "main branch" 

Once you have filled in the form you can save your changes by clicking on the "commit" button.
