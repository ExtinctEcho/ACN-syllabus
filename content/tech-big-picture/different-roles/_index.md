title: Tech roles and careers
---

As you have seen, the tech landscape is pretty vast and varied. This means that there are a lot of different roles to play and a lot of different careers that are suitable for different types of people.

Take a look at these, can you see how they fit into the bigger picture given what you know? 

Pay close attention, do any of these roles seem like they would suit you?

**Note:** Remember, these roles can vary widely by organization and many professionals wear multiple hats, especially in smaller organizations or startups.

## Software Developer/Engineer roles

This is the core role in software development. Software engineers design, code, and debug programs. They use programming languages like Python, Java, C++, etc., and they often specialize in areas like front-end (user interfaces), back-end (server-side programming), or full-stack (both front-end and back-end).

### Front-End Developer

This developer is responsible for the parts of the software that users interact with. They design and implement the visual elements of the software, such as the user interface and user experience.

### Back-End Developer 

They handle the server-side applications. This includes managing databases and ensuring that the server, the application, and the database run smoothly together.

### Full-Stack Developer

A full-stack developer has a mix of front-end and back-end development skills. They understand both the user interface and the data handling sides of development.

## Data Roles

### Data Scientist

Data scientists use statistical methods and machine learning to interpret and analyze data to solve complex problems. They design algorithms and predictive models to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

### Data Engineer

Data Engineers design, build, and maintain the systems and processes for collecting, processing and storing data. They work closely with Data Scientists and are often responsible for creating the architectures that allow efficient data processing.

### Machine Learning Engineer 

These engineers create data funnels and deliver software solutions. They typically have strong statistics and programming skills and use them to develop and implement machine-learning models.

## Security Engineer

Security Engineers are focused on the security aspect of software development. They are responsible for designing systems, implementing policies, and conducting audits to ensure that an organization's data is protected from threats.

## Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

QA engineers are responsible for testing software to detect and fix bugs before the product goes to market. They ensure that the software meets the company's standards of quality.

## User interface design roles

### UX (User Experience) Designer

UX Designers focus on creating a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. They research and test user interfaces to ensure they meet user expectations and needs.

### UI (User Interface) Designer

While UX designers focus on user experience, UI designers focus on the actual elements that users interact with. They decide on the colors, font, and layout of a software application.

## Management roles

### Scrum Master

A Scrum Master is a facilitator for an Agile development team. They are responsible for managing the exchange of information between team members and overcoming challenges that the team might face during the project.

### Business Analyst

A Business Analyst helps to bridge the gap between IT and business, using data analytics to assess processes, determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations and reports to executives and stakeholders.

### Project Manager

Project managers oversee a software project from conception to implementation. They coordinate between different teams, manage resources, and ensure that the project is on track
