Time to put on your research hat. One thing to know about software is that it tends to be built by teams and not individuals. 

In this project you'll be thinking critically about a few different best-practices in software development.

## Questions

1. Discuss the importance of code review in a software development process. How does it contribute to the overall quality of the software?

2. How should Code Review be prioritized in a dev project? Who needs to do it and when should it happen? And WHY? 

3. Unit testing is considered a fundamental aspect of software development. Explain its role and how it influences the final product.

4. How does unit testing contribute t good teamwork?

5. Consider the following statements, do you agree or disagree and why? UI/UX Designers come up with a design and then hand that over to the developers, developers should then implement it. There is no reason for a developer to be involved in the design process.

6. What are some best practices around "deep work".

7. What is technical debt? When is it ok? And how can you manage technical debt?

8. How can good use of version control act as a "safety net" when it comes to developing and deploying software?
