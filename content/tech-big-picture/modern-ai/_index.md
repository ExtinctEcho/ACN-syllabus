title: A brief history of AI
---

Artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of study officially began in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. The 1960s and 70s were marked by optimism in the AI community, but the high expectations were not met, leading to the "AI winter" in the 1980s, a period of reduced funding and interest in AI.

The revival of interest in AI started in the 1990s, driven by the rise of machine learning, a subfield of AI where computer systems learn from data. This was also the era when AI started to become commercially viable, with companies such as Amazon and Google using AI algorithms for recommendations and search respectively.

In the 2000s, AI began to impact various sectors, from healthcare to transportation. This era saw the development of autonomous vehicles and AI-driven diagnostic systems. The development and growth of AI during this period was driven by the availability of large amounts of data, advancements in computing power, and improvements in machine learning algorithms.

The 2010s was marked by the rise of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that models high-level abstractions in data using architectures composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Deep learning has enabled advancements in many areas of AI, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It was also during this decade that AI systems began to outperform humans in specific tasks, such as AlphaGo defeating the world champion Go player in 2016.

In the early 2020s, AI continued to evolve and become more embedded in society. There was a significant push towards democratizing AI, making it accessible to everyone and every company. This was facilitated by the development of more user-friendly AI tools and platforms that allowed even those without technical skills to create, test, and deploy AI-powered solutions​​.

Another notable trend was the rise of generative AI, which uses algorithms to create entirely new content, such as text, images, and videos. This was exemplified by models like GPT-3 and DALL-E from OpenAI, which could generate human-like text and images respectively​.

There was also an increasing focus on ethical and explainable AI. As AI systems began to be used in more critical decision-making processes, the need for transparency and fairness in these systems became increasingly important. This led to efforts to make AI decisions more understandable and to eliminate bias from automated decision-making systems​.

The role of AI in the workplace also continued to evolve, with more people working alongside smart machines designed to improve efficiency and productivity. This included the use of AI-powered virtual assistants and real-time dashboards and reporting​​.

Finally, there was a growing emphasis on sustainable AI. As AI algorithms and their supporting infrastructure require substantial power and resources, there was a push to make AI more energy-efficient and to use AI to help identify and address environmental challenges, such as deforestation and illegal fishing activities.

## The future of AI

If you have been paying any attention at all to AI in the news, you'll know that developments in AI are speeding up. There are new tools and techniques being released all the time. It's nearly impossible to stay on top of all the new developments. It can feel very overwhelming.
