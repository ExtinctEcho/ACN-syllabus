title: Intro to version control
---

If you ever want to build a serious piece of software then version control is a must. 

Here are a few articles that explain what it is all about. These articles do go into a bit of detail, and some of this stuff can feel a bit intimidating. 

At this point, it's good to focus on **why** version control is a good idea. 

- [What is version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
- [Version control: why do we need it?](https://medium.com/@lanceharvieruntime/version-control-why-do-we-need-it-1681f4888cec)
- [Importance of version control and why you need it](https://servian.dev/importance-of-version-control-and-why-you-need-it-aae53dac208a)

There are a lot of different version control tools out there, the one used most often in the software industry is called Git.

One thing that is really cool about Git is that there are a lot of companies that work hard to make Git more user-friendly in different ways. One such example is [GitHub](https://github.com/).

If you are not familiar with GitHub yet then now would be a good time to take it for a spin. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) is a nice tutorial that will familiarize you with basic concepts.
