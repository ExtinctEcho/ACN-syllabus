title: Introduction to open source
---

Open source software (OSS) is a key pillar in today's software development industry. It refers to software whose source code is available for anyone to look at, modify, and distribute. This openness is a fundamental shift from the traditional software development models where the source code is kept secret and users are only distributed the final, compiled product.

Open source software development thrives on collaboration and community involvement. Its philosophy is grounded in the belief that when developers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves, improves, and can better meet the needs of its users. This methodology allows people from all around the world to collaborate on a project, bringing together diverse perspectives and skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. It's a melting pot of ideas and creativity that has led to the development of some of the most popular and widely used software today.

## Some examples

There are many many examples of open-source software. Here are a few of the more famous ones:

- **Linux**: An open source operating system that's used extensively in server environments, supercomputers, and more. It's also the basis for the Android operating system, which powers the majority of the world's smartphones.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system that's become an industry standard for managing code in software development projects. It's also the technology that powers GitHub, a popular platform for hosting and collaborating on open source projects.
- **Apache HTTP Server**: An open source web server software that's been a significant player in the internet's growth. It has been the most popular web server on the internet since April 1996.
- **MySQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database management system that's widely used in web applications to store and retrieve data.
- **Python**: An open-source, high-level programming language that's known for its simplicity and readability. It's extensively used in data science, web development, automation, and more.
- **WordPress**: An open source content management system used to create websites and blogs. It powers a substantial portion of the world's websites.
- **VLC Media Player**: An open source, cross-platform multimedia player that can play most multimedia files as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
- **Blender**: A free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking.
- **GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)**: A free and open source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks.

## Getting involved

Involvement in open source projects offers numerous benefits for those entering the software industry. It provides a platform to gain real-world experience, improve coding skills, and understand different aspects of software development such as quality assurance, documentation, and user experience design. Additionally, participating in open source projects can be a valuable asset in your professional portfolio, demonstrating your capabilities to potential employers.

Open source is not just a software development model; it's a culture and a community. It's a way for programmers to share knowledge, collaborate on common problems, and contribute to the global technological landscape. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your journey in software development, getting involved in open source is an enriching and rewarding experience.

Getting involved in open source can be a rewarding experience, and there are many ways for individuals to begin their open source journey:

- **Start with What You Use**: If there's an open source tool or software that you use regularly, that could be a great starting point. Familiarize yourself with its community, how it works, and its contribution process.
- **Learn and Understand**: Spend time understanding how open source projects work. This includes understanding version control systems (like Git), issue tracking, pull requests, and the typical norms and etiquette in open source communities.
- **Pick a Project**: Choose an open source project that aligns with your interests. This could be something related to the programming languages you know, or a project related to an area you're interested in, like machine learning, gaming, web development, etc.
- **Start Small**: Look for "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly" tags in the project's issue tracker. These are issues that the project maintainers feel are suitable for newcomers to the project. It's a good idea to start with these smaller tasks to get a feel for the project and the process of contributing.
- **Ask for Help**: Don't be afraid to ask questions. Open source communities are generally welcoming and willing to help newcomers. If you're unsure about something, ask!

- **Contribute Beyond Code**: Open source is not just about code. You can contribute by improving documentation, creating tutorials, reporting bugs, and participating in discussions. These are valuable contributions to the project.

- **Follow the Project's Contribution Guidelines**: Most open source projects have a set of guidelines for contributing. Be sure to read and follow these - they'll tell you how to properly submit a bug report, how to submit your changes, and other important details about the project.

Remember, contributing to open source is not just about improving the software, it's also about learning, sharing, and being part of a community. So, don't be discouraged if things seem slow or challenging at first. With patience and persistence, you'll become a successful contributor.

This is also a great way to build a portfolio - if you contribute to open source in a meaningful way you can tell future employers about it.

## Common myths

There are several myths and misconceptions about open source software that can prevent people from fully understanding its potential. Here are a few common ones:

- **Open Source Software is of Low Quality**: This is a common myth due to the perception that something free cannot be of high quality. However, the reality is quite the opposite. Open source projects often have a global community of developers and enthusiasts contributing to them, which leads to more scrutiny and thus higher quality control. High-profile open source projects like the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, or the Firefox web browser are testament to this fact. If there are more eyes on the code then bugs get noticed and fixed sooner
- **Open Source Software is Not Secure**: Some believe that because the source code is publicly accessible, it's more susceptible to security vulnerabilities. While it's true that the code's visibility allows potential malicious actors to study it, this transparency also means a worldwide community of developers can inspect the code, identify security flaws, and quickly patch them. This often leads to more robust security in open source software compared to proprietary counterparts where the code is only reviewed by a limited set of developers.
- **Open Source Software is Only for Developers**: While it's true that developers benefit greatly from open source, it's far from being only for them. Many open source projects are designed with the end-user in mind and are as user-friendly as any proprietary software. Examples include the LibreOffice productivity suite, the GIMP image editor, and the VLC media player.
- **Open Source Software Doesn't Offer Support**: While it's true that open source software doesn't come with a dedicated customer service hotline like some proprietary software, this doesn't mean there's no support. Quite the contrary, there are often dedicated communities, forums, and sometimes even commercial entities that offer support services for open source software.
- **Open Source is Always Free**: While it's true that open source software is usually free to use, modify, and distribute, this doesn't necessarily mean it's always free of cost. Some organizations offer additional premium features, professional services, or commercial licenses for their open source software as a means of sustaining their work.

Understanding these myths and the reality behind them is an important step towards appreciating the value and potential of open source software.
