title: Reflect on your personal goals
---

Now you know quite a lot about how the software development world works. It's pretty big. It's very likely that some parts of this landscape were very exciting for you and some just were not. Maybe none of it is quite your cup of tea, and that's ok too.

In any case, now is a good time to reflect on what you know and think about where you might go next with this knowledge.

## Instructions 

Please answer the following questions:

1. Which areas of the course did you find most fascinating and why? Is there a specific topic you would like to dive deeper into?

2. What are some real-world applications of the concepts you learned in this course that excite you? How might you go about learning more about these applications?

3. In what ways has this course changed your perspective on software development and technology? How might this influence your future learning paths?

4. In thinking about the various roles in tech (like data scientist, data engineer, UI/UX designer, mobile developer, scrum master etc.), which ones are you most interested in exploring further? Why do those roles appeal to you?

5. Do you intend to try to pursue one of the roles you mentioned in the previous question? If yes, what are the next steps you want to take?

Reflecting on modern AI tools and their applications, what are some potential uses that intrigue you? What learning would you need to undertake to turn these ideas into reality?
