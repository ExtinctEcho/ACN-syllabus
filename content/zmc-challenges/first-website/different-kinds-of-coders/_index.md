blurb: There are lots and lots of different kinds of coding. Web development is a
  great way to start off but it's really not for everyone. In this section you'll
  learn about a few different career paths and we'll point you at some free and awesome
  learning resources so you can take yourself to the next level

Well done! You've finished all the projects in this challenge.  We hope you pushed yourself and learned a bunch!

This challenge just scratched the surface of web development. It's our hope that you feel empowered, inspired and equipped to keep on learning.  

What follows below are a bunch of resources and advice for how to continue learning and growing on your own:

## Practice makes perfect

Coding is a craft: Doing courses is good, but it's very important to actually make use of the skills you are learning. 

As you learn more things try to take your knowledge and demonstrate it in cod. Put that code on Github. One day when you are job hunting then you'll have some evidence of your learning. 

## How the web works

Before you go too far down any rabbit hole, it's useful to get a high level view of how the internet works. It will make it easier for you to choose the right path.

## Continuing with HTML and CSS

To keep learning about HTML and CSS here are a few resources:

- W3Schools: You already interacted with this
- MDN developer docs: These docs are very in depth, this is great because you'll get a full picture of how everything works, but it can be a bit confusing. 
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/): This is quite a wonderful resource, but sometimes it is a bit hard to follow.

One of the benefits of using FreeCodeCamp is that it does have a kind of certification system built in and it's pretty well respected. If you get a FreeCodeCamp certification people will kni=ow that you know what's up.  

## Learning JavaScript 

As mentioned earlier, Javascript can let you add smarts and interactivity to your websites. But Javascript isn't just limited to web development. You can use it on the "backend" as well.  

Some web developers choose to be pure frontend developers and they get really really good at HTML and CSS. And some choose to go deep on the interactivity side of things. In any case, it's useful to learn at least a little bit about JavaScript.

## Python

If you google "what programming language should I learn first" then you'll get a lot of different answers. Here's the thing though... it doesn't matter too much. 

If you go deep on learning one language and you end up needing to make use of another one then learning the nea one wont take you nearly as long. A lot of the "hard parts" of learning languages are exactly the same across different languages.

So how do you choose?

You want a language that is:

- as easy to learn as possible
- doesn't force you to write a whole lot of useless, confusing code to do any little thing
- is widely used in industry 

For those reasons we typically recommend learning Python. Python is a great teacher, has very tidy and clean syntax, and has a lot of use cases.

If you are interested in data-science, data engineering or automation then Python is for you.

Python is also pretty great at web development. Check this out: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
