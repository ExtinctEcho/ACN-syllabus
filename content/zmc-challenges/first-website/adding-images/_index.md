title: Adding images to your website

In this step we'll learn about a special kind of HTML tag. The img tag.

Here are a few resources for you:

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) has a nice guide to the syntax. But it does leave a few unanswered questions.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML) is more in depth. You don't need to know the whole document for now, just make sure you know what the `src` and `alt` attributes do

## Project instructions

You guessed it! You're now going to add a picture to your web page!

### 1. Get it to work on your machine

Create a directory named "images" on your device. It should be in the same location as your index.html file. 

```
your-project-directory/
    images/
    index.html
```

Add at least one picture to your images directory. You can choose a picture from the internet, or you can use a photo you already had. Whatever you want.

Now update your index.html so that the picture shows up. Make use of an `img` tag. Make sure you fill in the `src` and `alt` attributes.

Make sure that the picture shows up on your webpage.

### 2. Update your github page

Once you are satisfied that your picture is showing up, you'll need to upload your latest work to github. You can upload your things in the usual way.

When you look at your github repo then you should see your new index.html file as well as the images directory. 

### 3. Check your github page 

Your website changes will be automatically deployed to github pages. You wont need to reconfigure anything. Just go to your website and make sure it looks like what you were expecting. 

### 4. Submit 

You'll submit the link to your github page. You'll need to wait a little while for feedback again.

## Nice job! 

If you got this right then you would have had to level up a little bit. You now know a bit about how to reference other resources from inside an HTML page. This is a pretty big deal because the web wouldn't be a web if it wasn't interconnected.
