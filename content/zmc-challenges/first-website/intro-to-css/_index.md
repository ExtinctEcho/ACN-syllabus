title: Introducing CSS
---

Earlier on in this challenge we mentioned that CSS can be used to give your html style.

[Here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is a great tutorial on CSS.  You wont need to know the whole thing right now. Just read up until the end of "How To"

## Project instructions

### 1. Create a css file 

Create a css file in your repo and reference it in each of your html files by making use of a `<link/>` element. [This page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) will tell you how.

### 2. Add some styles 

Here are the requirements: 

- set the background colour of part of your web page. You can see the different ways to change a background [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp). Make sure you use the appropriate property to change the background colour
- change the colour of some text. Take a look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp) if you are not sure how 
- change the style of h1 elements so that they stand out more. You might want to change their size or font, or something else

Make sure that the css styles are being applied when you view your website.

### 3. Check your work

There are 2 different things you should do here:

1. Go to this website and validate your CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en#validate_by_input
2. Upload your latest changes to Github and make sure your page looks how you expect it to look
### 4. Submit your work 

Once you are happy with your work, upload your latest changes to Github and submit a link to your Github page in the usual way.
