Earlier on in this challenge we mentioned that CSS can be used to give your html style.

Here is a great tutorial on CSS.  You wont need to know the whole thing right now. Just read up until the end of "How To"

https://www.w3schools.com/css/

## Project instructions

### 1. Create a css file 

Create a css file called `styles.css` and reverence `styles.css` in each of your html files. [This page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) will tell you how.

### 2. Add some styles 

- set the background colour of your entire html page 
- change the colour of the text 
- change the style of h1 elements so that they stand out more

Make sure that when you view your website then the css changes are happening.

### 3. Submit your work 

Once you are happy with your work then upload your latest changes to github and submit a link to your github page.
