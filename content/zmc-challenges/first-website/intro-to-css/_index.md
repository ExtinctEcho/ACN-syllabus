Earlier on in this challenge we mentioned that CSS can be used to give your html style.

[Here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is a great tutorial on CSS.  You wont need to know the whole thing right now. Just read up until the end of "How To"

## Project instructions

### 1. Create a css file 

Create a css file in your repo and reverence it in each of your html files by making use of a `<link/>` element. [This page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) will tell you how.

### 2. Add some styles 

- set the background colour of your entire html page 
- change the colour of the text 
- change the style of h1 elements so that they stand out more. You might want to change their size or font, or something else

Make sure that when you view your website then the css styles are being applied.

### 3. Submit your work 

Once you are happy with your work then upload your latest changes to Github and submit a link to your Github page in the usual way.
