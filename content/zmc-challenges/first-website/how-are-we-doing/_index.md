TODO: survey link

We'd appreciate it if you could fill out the survey linked to below. We tried to keep it as short as possible. We basically want to know about:

- your experience of this challenge
- if you are likely to keep learning on your own
- what you might want to learn next - this will help us choose what to build next :) 

Thank you!
