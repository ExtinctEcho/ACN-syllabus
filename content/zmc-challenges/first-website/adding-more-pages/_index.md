---

In this section you are going to learn about making websites with multiple pages. First, you're going to need to learn about the anchor tags, also known as links.

Give these a read:

- [W3Schools documentation on links](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)
- [MDN documentation on links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

## Project instructions 

Now you are going to demonstrate your knowledge of links by adding a few to your site.

Here is what you need to do:

### 1. Create another page

On your local device create another page. It needs to have the following:

- a single h1 title 
- a link to your index.html page
- a link to another website. The href attribute should have an absolute url (check the MDN docs above if you don't know what that means)
- An unordered HTML list. It can contain whatever you want. You'll need to do a little bit of research to figure this one out :) 

### 2. Update index.html

Create a link from your index page to your new page. This link should make use of a relative url.

### 3. Update your repo 

Once everything seems to be working fine then upload your latest changes to github. Make sure your github page shows the latest version of your website.

### 4. Submit your link

Once you are happy that your github site does what it is meant to, submit the link to your github page and wait for feedback.
