title: Adding more pages
---

In this section, you are going to learn about making websites with multiple pages. First, you're going to need to learn about anchor tags, also known as links.

Give these a read:

- [W3Schools documentation on links](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)
- [MDN documentation on links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

## Project instructions 

Now you are going to demonstrate your knowledge of links by adding a few to your site.

Here is what you need to do:

### 1. Create another page

On your local device create another page. It needs to have the following:

- valid `<head>` and `<body>` elements
- a single `<h1>` title 
- a link to your `index.html` page
- a link to another website of your choice. The href attribute should have an absolute URL (check the MDN docs above if you don't know what that means)
- An unordered HTML list. It can contain whatever you want. You'll need to do a little bit of research to figure this one out :) 

### 2. Update index.html

Create a link from your `index` page to your new page. This link should make use of a relative URL.

### 3. Update your repo 

Once everything seems to be working fine then upload your latest changes to Github. Make sure your GitHub page shows the latest version of your website. Make sure the links on your website work.
### 4. Submit your project

Once you are happy that your Github page does what it is meant to, submit the link to your Github page and wait for feedback.
