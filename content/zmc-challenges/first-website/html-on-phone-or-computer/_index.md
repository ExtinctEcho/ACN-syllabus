title: How to get setup to author web code on your own device
---

Before we start coding, you'll need to know where to type your code. There are a few different options, please choose the one that works best for you. 

## Option 1: Just use a text Editor on your computer 

If you are using a computer and want to get set up in the easiest possible way then you can just use the build-in text editor. 

- If you are running windows you can just use Notepad
- If you are running a Mac then you can use TextEdit

You can see more detailed instructions [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp)

## Option 2: If you don't have access to a computer 

You can do this entire tutorial on a smart phone. You do still need a text editor though.

## Option 3: If you have a computer and want to be fancy about it

Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). It's a fancy text editor that is especially designed for coding.  You don't need it at this stage in your journey but it's cool. And we like to encourage cool things. 

If you can't install it or if it's weird and confusing then don't worry :) You can just use a text editor.

## If none of the above work 

If none of these options work fo you then you might need to do some research. Basically all you need is a text editor and a way to open files in a browser. Google is your friend :) 

## Check yourself!

Before you move onto the next step in the challenge make sure you can:

1. create new html files

2. write content in those files 

You don't need to understand HTML just yet (we'll get there soon!). Just copy this content in and make sure you can save the files:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

3. view those files in a web browser 
4. Make changes to your html files and see the changes in your browser. Eg try to change your html code to look like this:


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<h2>A smaller heading</h2>

<p>My second paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Once you can do that, then it's time to move onto the next step :)
