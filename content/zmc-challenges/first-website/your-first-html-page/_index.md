## Check your understanding before moving forward:

Understanding is critical for coders. Before you move forward, it's important that you understand a few things. Can you answer the following questions for yourself?

- What is the purpose of HTML?
- What is an HTML element?
- What is an attribute?
- What is the difference between `<h1>` and `<h2>`? What do these represent?
- How do you make a paragraph? What happens if you put 2 paragraphs underneath each other? (You can write some code yourself to check yourself)
- Where must the document type declaration be?
- What is a tag? 
- What is the difference between an opening tag and a closing tag?
- How do you make use of opening and closing tags?

If you are unsure of anything then go back to the tutorial, or spend some time on Google.

## Your mission 

Your mission is to make a website of your very own. It will just be one page for now. 

It's very important that you follow the instructions exactly, in the next step you will be deploying your website to the web.  It will need to do exactly the right thing!

### 1. Create a new html file called `index.html`

It is important to name the file exactly right! We'll be putting it on the internet in the next step. 

### 2. Let's make some content 

This website can be about anything you want. If you like cats it can be about cats, if you like books then make it about books. Write some html code that meets the following requirements:

- it must be valid and clean html
  - the document type declaration must be correct
  - you should be making use of valid tags
  - any tag you open should get closed
- it needs to have ONLY ONE `<h1>` heading 
- it needs to make use of `<h2>` headings
- it needs to make use of paragraphs
- there should be no text that is sitting outside of a heading or paragraph element.

### That's it 

Make sure your website works on your own device. In the next step we'll get it online!
