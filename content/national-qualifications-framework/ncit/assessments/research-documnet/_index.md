Submit a copy of your research notes from your "design thinking sprint" (DTS) or your "make us better" (MUB) sprint in which you document your research findings in an organised way. 

If you did not attend the above or no longer have access to your project you will need to conduct research on game design.

Required format: Google Doc

Upload the document to google drive and submit a link. Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it.
