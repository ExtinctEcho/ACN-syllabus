## PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

### INTRODUCTION TO BEING PROFESSIONAL

When dealing with various clients and stakeholders of a business, it is important to keep a professional relationship. We should commit ourselves to doing what is honourable and right. Ethical and professional behaviour instils business confidence, and it's mandatory in establishing the credibility of professionals. Ethical behaviour is not always a black or white issue, nor is it always easy. Conflicts of interest, contradictory requirements or processes, fear of failure, and business pressures can all affect ethical behaviour. Being professional in all circumstances can benefit your reputation, morale, and the success of your career. 

You can achieve this by adopting clear standards of ethics and appropriate professional behaviour. These standards and behaviours will assist you in always making wise decisions even when confronted with difficult situations which may compromise your integrity.

![integrity,truth,commitment](integrity,truth,commitment.jpg)

Ethics are not just a vague theory but a working concept that can have an important and real effect on your professional practice. Ethics are not simply a matter of obeying the law; it goes much beyond this. You will also see that the ethical decision  is not always simple, there are always a lot of factors to consider when making a decision. You will however be required to act with integrity.


Below, in Figures 1 and 2, are some guidelines that define what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour and conduct for professionals.

Figure 2: Unacceptable practices


Now that we've identified some acceptable and unacceptable practices in consultancy, why do you think it's important to know the difference between the two?

Please watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmOCHYz530) on being ethical even when no one is watching. 

To further guide our decision-making process in upholding this code of ethics and professional conduct PMI has compiled a framework for decisions making which can be found [here.](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/ethics/ethical-decision-making-framework.pdf?v=53450dfb-bf1d-4596-b639-018ab1163300&sc_lang_temp=en)


### PROFESSIONAL BODIES

All major industries in the corporate world are governed by professional bodies that set guidelines to help protect and inform the benchmark for standard conduct for all the professionals in the industry. As a professional, it is a good idea for you to stay up to date with new guidelines and rules in your field of work Business Analysis.


The Business Analytics discipline aims at understanding the needs of the business stakeholders and at defining the characteristics of the solution to meet those needs while Project management focuses on the creation of the “product, service, or result '' of the project in order to meet its objectives. Because of the strategic opportunities that lie in the integration of these two disciplines their governing bodies are also integrated.  

Two professional bodies have for decades made great contributions to both PM and BA as disciplines. 

#### 1. The Project Management Institute (PMI)

#### 2. The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)

Now that we understand ethics and why they exist, and what we can learn from them you will be better equipped to apply them to your context and working environment.  

Let's move on to the next module to learn about Business Ecosystems.
