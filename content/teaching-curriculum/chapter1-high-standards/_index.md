Here is the [12-page book summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ace5039zhdNbrd4CBgXz3GikFpPwMLru/view?usp=share_link) which you'd have seen in the quick familiarity project(s). It might be useful if you need a very brief refresher on the various techniques. Note that the scope of focus for this whole course encompasses everything that we do as teachers at Umuzi, including Code Reviews, Technical Sessions, learner support, and any other interactions we might have with learners.

In this project, we're going to hone in on the first chapter, which is focused on techniques that set and uphold high academic standards.

These are the 5 techniques covered in the chapter:

1. No Opt Out
2. Right is right
3. Stretch it
4. Format matters
5. Without apology

## Your Mission Objectives

Answer the following questions in 300 words or less:

1. For each of these 5 techniques, reflect on your experiences as a learner and describe a teacher you can remember who applied the technique well or poorly in your classroom.

2. Suggest 1 system change that you think should be put in place to improve and uphold high academic standards? Describe your suggested system change in at least 3 paragraphs.
