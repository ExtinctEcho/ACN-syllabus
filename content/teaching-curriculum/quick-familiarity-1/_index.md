title: Quick Familiarity - Part 1
---

As mentioned in the introductory topic of the course, the point of the quick familiarity projects is to do a quick skim of all of the techniques in the book, just to introduce you to the ideas and make sure that we can all start using the common language that the book provides for talking about nuanced teaching practices. Weâ€™ll practice the techniques more thoroughly later, but for now, let's just get acquainted with them.

[This 12-page book summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ace5039zhdNbrd4CBgXz3GikFpPwMLru/view?usp=share_link) provides a nice 1-page intro to the methodology that author Doug Lemov and team used to distill the best teaching practices from the best teachers in the country.

To keep the projects bite-sized, we'll look at 3 chapters at a time and do some light reflection and planning.

## Your Mission Objectives:

- Read through the first 5 pages of the summary pdf (up to the end of chapter 3).
- For each of the 3 chapters:

1. In 300 words or less, describe which of the techniques you already apply pretty well when you teach and describe how you apply the technique.

   1.1. Explain how you know that the technique works.

2. Which technique do you think has the greatest potential to improve your teaching abilities(choose 1)? Be sure to motivate your choice with some sound reasoning.
