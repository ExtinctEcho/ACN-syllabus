## Introduction

Understanding the difference between good comments and bad comments is essential for effective code communication and collaboration. Good comments provide purposeful explanations, relevant information, and clarity, while avoiding redundancy and outdated content. By following these principles, developers can create comments that enhance code comprehension, facilitate maintenance, and promote a positive coding environment.

## Comment Evaluation

1.Here are some code examples, please rewrite the code in a clearer way. Please make sure you only make use of comments that are actually useful. You are welcome to change function and variable names.

Python:

```python
def area_of_rectangle(length, width):
  area = length * width
  return area


length = 5
width = 10
result = area_of_rectangle(length, width)
print("Area of the rectangle:", result)
```

Java:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int length = 5;
    int width = 10;
    int result = areaOfRectangle(length, width);
    System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + result);
  }

  public static int areaOfRectangle(int length, int width) {
    int area = length * width;
    return area;
  }
}
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
function areaOfRectangle(length, width) {
  let area = length * width;
  return area;
}

const length = 5;
const width = 10;
const result = areaOfRectangle(length, width);
console.log("Area of the rectangle:", result);
```

2.In your own words, explain what makes a good comment.

3.Describe one scenario where a bad comment could cause confusion or misunderstanding.

4.In your own words, explain why maintaining up-to-date comments is important in code development.
