## Task Description
**1. Compile Information**

Using the information in the **Topic: Portfolio of work**, and the different links in the Resources section, compile all your information in a document. Review your work and select the best project(s) you would like to include in your portfolio. You can use screengrabs, icons and a range of other visual materials to communicate your ideas.

**2. Creating your Portfolio**

Now that you’ve compiled all the information you need, you will be required to create your own portfolio using this information. 
Here are some simple steps to follow:
* Decide on the tool you will be using. You can use the following tools to assist with a stand-alone document:
    + Figma 
    + Powerpoint / Keynote / Slides 
    + GoogleDocs 
    + Canva 
- Decide on visual and design approach for portfolio: select a font/colour/voice and tone
- Create a cover page and *“About Me”* section
- Decide on the structure of each project
- Prepare and insert your projects

## Instructions for reviewer:
- Overall look and feel of the portfolio
- Does the portfolio include a *“About Me”* section?
- Does their portfolio showcase their skills?

When giving feedback please remember to be thorough and constructive, remember a peer review whether competent or not yet competent should be a gift that helps your peers get into industry. Reviewing is also an opportunity for you to improve your work. Try to look for 3 things that they have done really well and 3 things they could improve on.
