## Task Description
1. Using the content layed out in **Topic: Online Profile** set up your various online profiles. Be sure to set them up completely and keep them professional.
    - Submit a link to another online profile (Not LinkedIn - that you already submitted previously)

***Tip: Also remember to add all the info, links, and work you have done in other sections of this course i.e. your Portfolio and you CV***

## Instructions for reviewer
- Check that the links work correctly and that the profile submitted is fully accessible.

When giving feedback please remember to be thorough and constructive, remember a peer review whether competent or not yet competent should be a gift that helps your peers get into industry. Reviewing is also an opportunity for you to improve your work. Try to look for 3 things that they have done really well and 3 things they could improve on.
