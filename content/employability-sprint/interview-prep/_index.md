Landing an interview is only half the battle won. The next step is to prepare for your interview. This can cause major anxiety – especially if you are new to the process. 

The next milestone is getting from one interview round to the next. Companies generally interview multiple candidates at every stage, so it’s to be expected that you won’t always advance to the next round. The good news is that you can increase your interview success rate by practicing and preparing. 

Interviewing for a position can be scary, but this is an amazing opportunity to sell yourself. The first five minutes of an interview set the tone and could get you the opportunity – or lose it.

## Preparation Before The Interview
You really want to ace the interview, and with that in mind, you need to practice. Don't take it easy or simply ‘wing it’ – you want to be ready to answer those difficult questions.

There is a lot that can go wrong in an interview, and since you’ll be nervous, you want to make sure you do everything you can in advance to help it go right.

### *Review Everything!*
- **Your CV** – make sure you are familiar with your CV.
- **The job description** – you need to be intimately familiar with the role you have applied for as well as how your skills relate to it.
- **The company** – research the company, their history, what they do, who works there, and know why you want to work there. You want to make a good impression, and putting in extra effort and being knowledgeable does this.
- Prepare a list of **questions for the interviewer** about the company, team, and position you will be working in.
- **Your portfolio** – the past projects you have showcased here could come up, so make sure that if you showed something off you remember the tools, techniques, and technologies that you used.
- Prepare a list of **questions that you would expect from the interviewer**, and try to get in their head so that you can anticipate and prepare for them. Even if they ask something different, this preparation will help you.

### *For An In-Person Interview:*
- Make sure you dress correctly. If you are unsure, ask about the company’s dress code beforehand.
- Presentation is more than just dress code – also make sure your hair and personal hygiene are up to scratch.
- Make sure you leave with ample time to get there – ideally you want to walk in 10 minutes early. And if you arrive in the area earlier, try to walk into reception no earlier than 15 minutes early.
- Make sure you have a copy of your CV as well as any relevant pieces of your portfolio with you.
- Make sure you have a pen and notebook, and use it. No one's memory is perfect, and this also adds to your professional image.


### *For A Virtual Interview:*
- Find out what video software will be used. Make sure you test it out a few days in advance.
- Dress code – even in a video interview, you need to be presentable.
- Check your connection and make sure you have a backup connection.
- Check your power – do you have any scheduled maintenance or interruptions?
- Having a pen and paper available is also very useful and professional.
- Be prepared to share your screen should you want to showcase a project.
- Be prepared for them to share their screen should they want to ask questions on a project. 

If, during the interview, you are asked something that you don't know, the best approach is to admit that you don't know, but show a willingness to do some research and get back to them. 

## Practice Makes Perfect
There are some wonderful platforms that facilitate mock interviews with peers or mentors. Some of the peer-driven ones are even accessible for free and can be incredibly helpful – especially if you take individual bits of feedback with a pinch of salt, but pay close attention to which bits of feedback remain consistent across multiple interviews. 

If you can afford to buy some time with a more seasoned interview mentor, it can be well worth it. The perspective they bring “from the other side of the table” can be invaluable. 

Try out one of the below interview prep tools in order to make sure you are ready for your next interview.

The tool transcribes your answers to interview questions in real time so you can review what you said and learn from insights uncovered by machine learning.

Your responses aren’t graded or judged and you can answer questions as many times as you want. It’s your own private space to practice, prepare, and get comfortable with interviewing.

When used correctly, the tool can assist in reducing the anxiety that comes with interviewing for jobs. Regardless of the field you're in or the role you're applying for, the tool coaches you by giving you insights into your responses to help you improve your interview skills.

# INTERVIEW PREPARATION FOR TECH STREAMS

There are many general-purpose guides available on how to prepare for software engineering interviews. This is one of our favourites: [Interviewguide.dev](https://interviewguide.dev/)

## Automated Technical Tests
Often, you’ll need to first pass technical tests at home before even getting into the room with a human recruiter. Code tests are a quick and easy (and highly automated) way to assess whether you have the basic skills needed to land the interview. Normally they don’t expect juniors to get 100%, but they do want to get a better understanding of your skills.

### Preparation
Practice makes perfect and there are many  sites that allow you to practise your coding skills.

Focus on your general problem-solving skills. These links are great for this: 
- [DevSkiller Web Dev Skills Tests](https://devskiller.com/coding-tests-skill/web-development/#)
- [CoderByte.com Skills Testing Platform](https://coderbyte.com/?utm_campaign=Employer%20-%20coderbyte.com/organizations&utm_source=orange_top_bar)

Technical interviews are notoriously biassed towards questions on algorithms and data structures, for which you can and should prepare well.
- Read this: [Leetcode style interviews](https://interviewguide.dev/leetcode)
- And watch this: [Neetcode: How I got Good at Coding Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&ab_channel=NeetCode). We particularly like how the Neetcode video groups and abstracts the types of problem-solving approaches that tend to work for different types of problems. 


Practising a wide variety of problems on the platforms mentioned above should power you up to tackle anything the technical test throws at you. You can never know exactly what they’ll test you on, so instead of trying to “hack the test”, practise a variety of different problem types on various platforms. If the first few interviews don’t go well, you’ll at least gather valuable data on where to lean in more.

### The actual test
One place where a lot of people go wrong in these tests is poor use of time. Below is a basic procedure to try out. Of course, everyone is different and you might want try a different approach, but this one has worked for many people:

#### Step 1: Browse
The first thing to do is read through all the questions. Get a basic idea of what you are dealing with. Your subconscious brain will then start working on the problems in the background. 

#### Step 2: Pick a question
Choose something that looks doable to start off with to get your brain warmed up. Double check your understanding of the question.

Make sure you RTFQ! It's very important that you don't jump to conclusions.

#### Step 3: Decompose into smaller problems
Most problems can be broken down into smaller problems. Do your best to decompose the test question and work through all its parts one at a time. Be consistent and keep your logic clear. The intention of your code must be clear at all times.


#### If you hit a wall...
If you get stuck, don't immediately give up and move on. And don't just bash your head against the problem until you run out of time. Check how much time you have left, and set a time limit for yourself. Somewhere between two and five minutes is generally good.

Bash your head against the problem and focus as hard as you can on this one problem for those two-five minutes. 
If you make a breakthrough, continue working. If you are still completely stuck at the end of your two-five minutes, move onto another question. You can come back to this question once you have attempted others. 

#### Multitasking
Multitasking slows you down and splits your focus. Seriously, don't try to think about two problems at the same time. Focus on one thing, and then continue.

#### If you finish the test ahead of time
Go and read over all your answers:
- check for bugs
- double check that your code is clean and understandable. Remember that coders work in teams. If your code makes you seem inconsiderate and short-sighted, that would be a bad thing

#### If you panic
Tests can be scary, we get it. But panic isn't useful. If you are feeling overwhelmed, stop what you are doing, take a deep breath, and intentionally slow down.

Yes, slow down. By slowing your movements, you actually calm yourself.

Focus your mind only on the one problem that is right in front of you. It might be a single question, or even a single part of the question.

Sometimes when people panic, they start to jump from question to question. This isn't useful. Use the time-boxing technique mentioned above to stop yourself from doing that and to help you focus. For two-five minutes, you only have one problem to think about. Do your best on that one problem.
 

## In-Person Technical Interviews
Lots of companies only do these after you’ve done “well enough” on an automated test, but some prefer to do these earlier in the process. Either way, the preparation discussed in the section on automated technical tests should power you up quite well for these as well. 

In this section, we’ll explore some of the softer skills and live-interview techniques that will make a difference during in-person technical interviews. 

### Talking About Your Experiences + Portfolio
This is a very important part as it is a visual representation of the skills that a recruit/junior has.

Most companies ask, for example, for a link to the candidate’s repo to see their work.
- Know your CV incredibly well. Chances are you will be asked to talk about the work you've done.
- Make sure to have the correct link to your GitHub repo. It’s very important to check that everything on your GitHub profile works as it should.

### Theoretical Technical Questions
These are questions that are specific to the role that you’re going to be filling.
It helps interviewers see if you know what the job involves and if you can fulfil the role.

You can prepare for this by:
- Getting to know exactly what is involved in the role you are applying for so you can see what you need to either prepare for or sharpen.
- Practising common terminologies in that specific language/jargon and ensuring that you’re able to explain them.

If you get interviewed and you get asked a question that you don't know the answer to, admit that you are unsure. Don't ever, ever pretend to know something you don't.

## Culture Fit/Behavioural Interviews
Any interaction you have with a human at the employing organisation will feed into a “culture fit” assessment, but sometimes employers will set up time with senior staff specifically to assess “culture fit”. 
Cultural fit is the likelihood that you will be able to conform and adapt to the core values and collective behaviours that make up the organisation where you are applying for a job opportunity..

Your biggest weapons in these sessions are preparation and empathy. The better you understand the context of the organisation and the person sitting across from you, the better equipped you are to align what you can offer with what they are looking for ––whether from a skills standpoint or in terms of values alignment. 

These articles give great overviews of how to engage well at every step of the process, as well as how to prepare for the relational/people-focused side of the interview process:

- [My advice after interviewing 100 software engineers](https://medium.com/swlh/my-advice-after-interviewing-100-software-engineers-e34bc3cbc669)

Remember that you can also ask people in your network for support on this. Friends, mentors, or even just kind acquaintances in the industry can often be a powerful resource in your preparations. As we mentioned earlier in the course, people generally do want to help. Sometimes you just need to ask!
