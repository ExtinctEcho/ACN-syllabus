Landing an interview is only half the battle won. The next step is to prepare for your interview. This can cause major anxiety – especially if you are new to the process. 

The next milestone is getting from one interview round to the next. Companies generally interview multiple candidates at every stage, so it’s to be expected that you won’t always advance to the next round. The good news is that you can increase your interview success rate by practicing and preparing. 

Interviewing for a position can be scary, but this is an amazing opportunity to sell yourself. The first five minutes of an interview set the tone and could get you the opportunity – or lose it.

## Preparation Before The Interview
You really want to ace the interview, and with that in mind, you need to practice. Don't take it easy or simply ‘wing it’ – you want to be ready to answer those difficult questions.

There is a lot that can go wrong in an interview, and since you’ll be nervous, you want to make sure you do everything you can in advance to help it go right.

### Review Everything!
- **Your CV** – make sure you are familiar with your CV.
- **The job description** – you need to be intimately familiar with the role you have applied for as well as how your skills relate to it.
- **The company** – research the company, their history, what they do, who works there, and know why you want to work there. You want to make a good impression, and putting in extra effort and being knowledgeable does this.
- Prepare a list of **questions for the interviewer** about the company, team, and position you will be working in.
- **Your portfolio** – the past projects you have showcased here could come up, so make sure that if you showed something off you remember the tools, techniques, and technologies that you used.
- Prepare a list of **questions that you would expect from the interviewer**, and try to get in their head so that you can anticipate and prepare for them. Even if they ask something different, this preparation will help you.
- Prepare a list of questions that you would like to ask at the interview. Maybe you are curious about their choice of tools, maybe you want to know what kinds of tasks you will be doing when you start out, or how the company maintains their culture. Getting answers will help you make a good decision and asking thoughtful questions will leave a good impression!

### For An In-Person Interview:
- Make sure you dress correctly. If you are unsure, ask about the company’s dress code beforehand.
- Presentation is more than just dress code – also make sure your hair and personal hygiene are up to scratch.
- Make sure you leave with ample time to get there – ideally you want to walk in at least 10 minutes early. And if you arrive in the area earlier, try to walk into reception no earlier than 15 minutes early.
- Make sure you have a copy of your CV as well as any relevant pieces of your portfolio with you.
- Make sure you have a pen and notebook, and use it. No one's memory is perfect, and this also adds to your professional image.


### For A Virtual Interview:
- Find out what video software will be used. Make sure you test it out a few days in advance. Make sure your sound quality is good as well
- If you are worried about load-shedding or have a sketchy internet connection, make a plan! Go do your interview somewhere with a reliable connection
- Dress code – even in a video interview, you need to be presentable
- Check your connection and make sure you have a backup connection.
- Check your power – do you have any scheduled maintenance or interruptions?
- Having a pen and paper available is also very useful and professional.
- Be prepared to share your screen should you want to showcase a project.
- Be prepared for them to share their screen should they want to ask questions on a project. 

### Be honest about your skills
If, during the interview, you are asked something that you don't know, the best approach is to admit that you don't know, but show a willingness to do some research and get back to them. Don't ever try to misdirect your interviewer by telling them about cool things you know that don't answer the question, stay on topic.

Never ever try to bullshit your interviewer, don't misrepresent your skills, don't say "that's what I meant" if your interviewer corrects one of your answers. Be honest and represent your skills accurately. 

If you are ever unsure if you have answered a question accurately you can say "does that answer your question?" or even "Sorry, I'm a bit nervous, what was the question again?"

## Practice Makes Perfect
There are some wonderful platforms that facilitate mock interviews with peers or mentors. Some of the peer-driven ones are even accessible for free and can be incredibly helpful – especially if you take individual bits of feedback with a pinch of salt, but pay close attention to which bits of feedback remain consistent across multiple interviews. 

If you can afford to buy some time with a more seasoned interview mentor, it can be well worth it. The perspective they bring “from the other side of the table” can be invaluable. 

Try out one of the below interview prep tools in order to make sure you are ready for your next interview.
