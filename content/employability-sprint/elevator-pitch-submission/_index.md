title: Submit your elevator pitch
---

This subject is a little different from the others - it's much more personal, focusing on your most important selling tool: you! 

Personal branding and persuasion can be helped along if you have a ready-prepared, 30-second "elevator pitch” that you can use to introduce yourself and your best points to any interested parties. 

## Task Description
1. Consider your strongest points and interests.
2. Write a 30-second elevator pitch in which you highlight the best aspects of yourself
- Grab their attention
- Introducing yourself
- Provide a summary of what you do (past and present)
- Future/Goals
- Describe the unique value you offer/Why you are a good fit
3. Record your elevator pitch and upload it to youtube as “Unlisted”, this will allow your reviewers to view it with the link. (Without the link they will be unable to view it)
- Plan what you will wear as well as the background of your video

## Instructions for reviewers
- Check how the learner is dressed, and where the video was created
- Is the contents of the video appropriate
- Are the appropriate topics covered?
- **Would you hire this person?**

When giving feedback please remember to be thorough and constructive, remember a peer review whether competent or not yet competent should be a gift that helps your peers get into industry. Reviewing is also an opportunity for you to improve your work. Try to look for 3 things that they have done really well and 3 things they could improve on.
