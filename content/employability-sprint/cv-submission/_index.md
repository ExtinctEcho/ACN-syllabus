## Task Description
1. Using the content in the previous sections update your current CV, or create a new CV. Remember to go through the content in detail and apply all the learnings. 
2. Upload a link to your CV (make sure the share settings is set so *“Anyone with the link”* can view the document)

## Instructions for reviewer
- Check that the CV is structured well and easy to read and follow
- Check the spelling and grammar
- Does CV include contact details?
- Does CV include all required sections (personal statement, experience, education and skills)?
- Test to see if hyperlinks are working
- **Would you hire this person?**

When giving feedback please remember to be thorough and constructive, remember a peer review whether competent or not yet competent should be a gift that helps your peers get into industry. Reviewing is also an opportunity for you to improve your work. Try to look for 3 things that they have done really well and 3 things they could improve on.
