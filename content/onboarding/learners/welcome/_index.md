##**Who are we and what do we do?**

At the heart of Umuzi is our energy, our commitment and passion to reduce social inequality in Africa through digital education. We are excited about what we do, who we work with and the value we are adding on a daily basis. We do this with warmth, empathy, and dynamism. We are a bold, daring and exciting organisation, creating meaning through sharing our energy - itâ€™s contagious!

Through our energy we create connection with individuals that enables a shift to occur, causing a ripple effect, creating communities. This ripple effect has an impact on the people we meet, we work with, partner with, and then their families and friends, not just in the present, but in the future too. 

The young people (YOU) that move through our programmes are at the heart of what we do at Umuzi, and it is their journey and stories that drive us to continue on this mission.

Join us in being part of this movement!

**ENERGY, CONNECTION, IMPACT**
