# **Quizz Time**
Now that you've had a chance to learn about the policies we have at Umuzi and how they protect everyone in this community, let's check how much of the knowledge
you've managed to grasp and where you might need a little help :)

Follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GXRHu8656_PmQ7NX-qMgIFJgam77_OoeYtm4IngYFiU/edit) and download the document (make a copy). 

Rename the document to include your name. Eg, Policy Quiz_Thabo Dlamini

Complete all the questions.

Upload the document to google drive and submit a link. 

- Make sure that the link works. 
- If your work is private then we won’t be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser. Set Share to ‘Anyone with the link can view’
